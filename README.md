PASSNUMBER AND IMAGE BASED METHOD AND COMPUTER PROGRAM PRODUCT TO AUTHENTICATE USER IDENTITY

Abstract
An authentication process is disclosed which uses categories of icons to create an easy to remember passnumber for use with an electronic platform. The process may assign each icon a discrete value during registration. A hash value is created based on combining the discrete values for each icon in the passnumber. During a login process, the user is presented with the icons, sometimes in a randomly shuffled. The user may input the icons that make up his or her passnumber. The process may access stored values for user selected icons in the login passnumber entry field and calculate a login hash value. The process may then determine whether the login hash value matches the registration hash value to permit or deny login access to the electronic platform.
