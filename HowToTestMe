How to use PassNumber script to authenticate your user’s identity instead of Password?
Kindly follow below steps to test the application successfully (I recommend you to watch trail demonstration on YouTube at:
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCALlTcRAsm9zyltRD5A1dhg
Install the script of PassNumber:

1.	Download the clone and unzip it.
2.	Add it to your c:/xampp/htdocs/
3.	Add passnumber.sql to your localhost database.
4.	Enter localhost/passnumber/index.php at your browser.

New user:
1.	Add your username.
2.	Chose 1 icon from each category from first row and enter its location number only (e.g. enter 1 for fish plate or 4 for spaghetti plate).
3.	Repeat previous step.
4.	Now, you should forget (neglect) 1 selection and represent that by entering "0" (e.g. if you selected fish palate and apple then cow and you won’t any icons from last category, simply enter passnumber: 1110
5.	You only need to memorize your icons not the passnumber.

Login step:
1.	Enter your username.
2.	Now, you need to represent your passnumber by locations of your icons (e.g. if first row have fish plate at location 3, you need to enter 3 at passnumber field. next row, if it was the neglected category, just enter any deceiving digits from 1-4 but not zero. but if the next category is fruits, then represent your Apple's location by entering it's number, I mean again, if it was at location 4, you need to enter 4. moving forward until you enter a 4 numbers of passnumber Not including Zeros.)
3.	Let say you resulting passnumber is 3142, then the script will test it and match it with the saved hashed number in database. If matched, you login successfully.
4.	Try to change the number that representing the neglected category, you will login successfully again!
5.	Try to enter your passnumber starting from any row, downward or upward, you will login successfully if you represent your icons' locations correctly.

Have fun ;)
